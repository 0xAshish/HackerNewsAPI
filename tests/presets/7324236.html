We're making a big mobile push and need your help.</p><p>Here's a testimonial we received recently:</p><p>==================================</p><p>Hi! My name is Chelsie and I'm a college student. When I was 19 years old I was kicked out of a great university because I had terrible grades. My disappointed parents cut me off financially so I began working night shifts to support myself. The truth is, I had no desire to go to school because learning had always seemed very distant from reality to me. ... Success in school felt like something you either had or you didn't, and I had been getting Cs since middle school….I stumbled across [your] videos about math. I HATED math. I watched them anyway. I don't know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I'm 24 now, and I'm in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As. Sal's videos made me feel like I had the capacity for understanding math and science even though my parents never sent me to space camp and I never won a ribbon at a science fair in elementary school...</p><p>==================================</p><p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for free, high-quality educational content.</p><p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>And now we're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We're totally overhauling our iOS app.</p><p>If you join us now, you can be a core developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.</p><p>You'll be part of a small team working alongside both "celebrity" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more of us normal folk ;) you haven't heard of but who are workin' hard to help education.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN.

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.</p><p>We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>We're a small startup (you'd be #11), but well funded ($4.1M) and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.</p><p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.</p><p>Recent coverage:</p><p>- <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcriptic-the-secret-robot-lab-that's-shaking-up-science" rel="nofollow">http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcript...</a></p><p>- <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4-1m-in-the-bank-transcriptic-wants-to-reinvent-scientific-research/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4...</a></p><p>team at transcriptic.com</p></font><p><font color="#000000"><a href="https://www.transcriptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a></font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325216" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7325216&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325216"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=surrealize">surrealize</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7325216">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco, CA | Cancer Therapeutics Innovation Group (CTIG)<p>Help cure cancer by building webapps.</p><p>At CTIG, we sequence the DNA of cancer tumors to recommend the right therapy for that tumor's specific DNA mutations. Patients and their oncologists use our analyses to help make decisions about how to treat their cancer. With us, you'd help build the systems that doctors and patients use to access and interpret our results, and work on the systems we use to manage our internal processes.</p><p>It's really important that our users (patients and doctors) be able to understand the results we're giving back to them. So we're looking for someone who can translate our analyses into web pages that are clear, simple, and well-designed. That makes front-end experience and an eye for aesthetics important, but you'll be working on the backend as well.</p><p>Our current web apps are built using:</p><p>* Scala, with the Play framework</p><p>* Python, with Django and Flask</p><p>* Javascript, with Angular.js and D3</p><p>* HTML/CSS/LESS with Bootstrap</p><p>* Postgres</p><p>It's great if you're familiar with those, but general web dev skill and the ability to pick up new tools and technologies is more important. Our other systems also use R, and we're experimenting with the Julia language, so if you're looking to work with interesting technology then you'll find kindred spirits here.</p><p>CTIG is located in Mission Bay in San Francisco, across the street from the UCSF campus here. We're a very interdisciplinary group, with bioinformaticians and computational biologists from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and UCSF; biologists from UCSF, and physicians from Harvard Medical School. Some of us have PhDs, some of us have MDs, and some of us are college dropouts; we're not credentialists, but we do have strong backgrounds in our respective fields. It's a small team with 6 programmers, so you'd be a core contributor and you'd help set our technical direction.</p><p>We're very serious about cancer, but pretty laid-back otherwise; office discussions range from the nitty-gritty details of molecular biology and machine learning to re-enactments of South Park episodes.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">We're looking for people who are authorized to work in the US, and can work full-time on-site in SF.

We're hiring for full time and summer intern positions as software developers and software designers.</p><p>A little bit about us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    Recently, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),
    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us access
    to lots of cool machines.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Hi! We’re Red Hot Labs from San Francisco and we're looking for a FULL-TIME DEV and a FULL-TIME ADMIN/GENERALIST.<p>We're on a mission to revolutionize how mobile developers harness their data.  Our product, still in beta, functions as the central hub for all the services mobile developers already use.  By weaving together the data from these disparate services, we gain a comprehensive view of the app and are uniquely positioned to deliver insights and value back to the developer.</p><p>This isn't our first trip around the block.  Our previous startup was acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the rest of Zynga’s most successful games.  It was a wild ride and now we’re full steam ahead on a new adventure. We're well backed by folks such as A16Z, Greylock, SVAngel, DCVC, and more.</p><p>We're looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented engineers to join our team.  By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We’re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.</p><p>We want all engineering members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we're especially excited about the following engineering profiles:</p><p>==================================</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Senior Product Engineer: You've built products from  concept all the way to 
  maturity.  You're as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  
  You're a master at JS/CSS/HTML and customer facing technologies. 
  Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular 
  (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.

  - Senior Systems Engineer: You've architected and scaled backend systems to 
  millions of users.  You've put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the 
  process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server 
  architectures, and low-level services. 

  - Senior Data Engineer: You've built models which extract insights or 
  predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an 
  unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area 
  experts with your result.  

  - Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don't have years of working experience, but 
  you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.  You were among 
  the best students at a top tier engineering university. Your TA's and

  ===========================

We're Waze for Cargo. Weft tracks shipping containers using low-cost hardware to make sure that shipments get to where they're supposed to be on time and intact, saving billions in lost value due to cargo shrink and disrupted supply chains. We  take the info we get from the hardware and figure out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predict whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically reroute/reschedule shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff.<p></p><pre><code>  ===========================

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.</p><p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers focusing on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.</p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Learn more at <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325365" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7325365&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325365"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jetsnoc">jetsnoc</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7325365">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><p></p><pre><code>    Senior PHP Engineer
    We Are Base&nbsp;
    Bournemouth, United Kingdom
    Full time, in house
</code></pre>
A bit about the role&nbsp;<p>This is a genuine opportunity to work alongside talented people to innovate and build digital services that make a difference to people every day, including an exciting product spin out. Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:</p><p>1st class engineer&nbsp;</p><p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura &amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs &amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality</p><p>Data hungry&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.</p><p>Open all hours&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.</p><p>Solver of riddles&nbsp;</p><p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.</p><p>Getting shit done&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.</p><p>Commercially aware&nbsp;</p><p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.</p><p>Keen eye, tuned ear&nbsp;</p><p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.</p><p>Security and speed&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.</p><p>About We Are Base</p><p>We're a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.</p><p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable.&nbsp;Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.</p><p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.</p><p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.</p><p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.</p></font><p><font color="#000000"><a href="http://wearebase.com/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://wearebase.com/hiring</a></font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325893" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7325893&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325893"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=smikhanov">smikhanov</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7325893">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">London, UK — Fountain Digital Labs (<a href="http://www.fountain-digital.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fountain-digital.com</a>) — All-round backend developer<p>We're a well-funded 1.5 year old startup working on the delivery of live video streams from our own cameras around the globe into an iPad app for children. We're currently rolling out our first two installations — in Dubai and in Moscow. And we just grew to ten people.</p><p>Both the client part (iOS) and the video processing backend (Python/ffmpeg) are being actively developed in-house. We're currently looking for a Python developer, full-time in London. Our office is at TechHub, in the heart of the Silicon Roundabout, but we'll be moving to the new office in the same area very soon.</p><p>The usual job description blurb is at our landing page at <a href="http://www.fountain-digital.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fountain-digital.com</a>. I want to add that it's a great opportunity for a backend developer to get involved in a very serious wide-scale project. We're not in the business of making websites or Facebook apps, our video cloud routinely loads tens of large Amazon EC2 instances — and grows automatically as you add new video streams. We're really doing interesting work here.</p><p>If you've never done Python in production, but love distributed systems, programming at scale and are a strong all-rounder — feel free to apply anyway. We love working with smart and hardworking people.</p><p>If you want to ask anything about the product, technology, or anything else, drop me a line (I'm the CTO).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Secret Local: HALF-TIME/FULL-TIME/INTERN<p>Portland, OR or New York, NY</p><p>Hey guys... We got a great response on this back in January and now we are expanding.... So here is an updated version now that we are a team of two hiring.</p><p>Hey, HN. One of you is perfect for this idea.</p><p>We are two serial entrepreneurs currently trapped in the professions of being a freelance contractor. We have relatively stable 40 hour a week projects, and incoming projects as well that I generally can't take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)</p><p>So here's the idea.
You. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.
I would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.
(also now looking for 40 hours)</p><p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.</p><p>Here is what you get.
Money
Freedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)
Real World Education
Ability to become a killer coder
and whatever else. we are pretty flexible</p><p>Languages?
Python/Ruby Obj-C Javascript(Node)
You name it.
If you can show competency in some language we currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.</p><p>About us, your 'bosses'.
Boss #1 (Portland Office)
Early 30s. Built several large-scale enterprise applications used by Fortune 500 companies. Lead engineering and product for a VC-funded healthcare startup. Last company built infrastructure that stored over 1 billion objects and transferred hundreds thousand objects per day.</p><p>Currently living in PDX (Inner SE) and renting a space at a co-working facility. Open to having you work here, or at my house. I prefer day hours, 10-6pm PST, but I am flexible.</p><p>Boss #2 (New York Office)
Late 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the 'valley'. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.</p><p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.
I have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.</p><p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.</p><p>==============
tl;dr
Long story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.</p><p>You'll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).</p><p>We'll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">email hn0314@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7324425" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7324425&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7324425"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=robbiemitchell">robbiemitchell</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7324425">link</a></span></div><br>

I'm sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I'd love for you to be part of the incredible journey we've embarked upon.</p><p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we're seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we'd love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.</p><p>Do any of these areas stand out for you? I'd really love to hear from you:</p><p></p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we're sending 400,000 posts to social networks every day,
      our architecture is still not ideal)
    - Happiness (Support) Hacker (we have a crazy obsession for customer happiness
      and want to build our own tools to go beyond what's normal)
    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million downloads but currently no
      full-time developer!)
    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are all crying out for an
      iPad app)
    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%, we'd love your help
      improving it and many other metrics)
    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used Buffer, we'd love to improve
      our dashboard interface and extensions for them)
</code></pre>
Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p></p><pre><code>    - We're completely open about salary and equity, in fact here is a spreadsheet
      of all individual salaries: https://docs.google.com/a/bufferapp.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=1.
      It's most likely you'd fall into a range of $85,000-$120,000 and 0.1%-1%.
    - We're a fully distributed remote team, and we come together 3 times a year for
      super fun retreats. The last one was in Thailand in December, our next is
      Cape Town in April!
    - We have a big focus on culture, that's the main thing we think about when someone
      joins the team. Here is our slide deck of values: http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-03

The Climate Corporation's mission is to help all the world's people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change. We use a combination of weather monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide real-time pricing and purchasing of customizable weather insurance to farmers in the United States.<p>Climate's technical staff numbers around 80, and we're hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:</p><p>1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.</p><p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics/ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.</p><p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.</p><p>The scale and interdiscplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very important problems.</p><p>Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is lumped into two-week sabbaticals.
