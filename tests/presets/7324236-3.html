About OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc: OpenEye Scientific Software provides software to the pharmaceuticals industry for molecular modeling and cheminformatics.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">McKinsey Digital Labs is looking for INTERNS for summer 2014. These are paid positions in our New York office.<p>About the Firm:</p><p>McKinsey &amp; Company is one of the world’s premiere management consulting firms with some 8,500 consultants across 89 locations in 50 countries. The Firm provides a full spectrum of consulting services primarily to large corporations but also to governments, international institutions, and non-profit organizations. These organizations include 100 of the top 150 global companies, touching every major industry.</p><p>About MDL:</p><p>McKinsey Digital Labs (MDL) brings technological expertise to our clients as one of McKinsey's new delivery models. We do this through our various service lines, which include:
	-Advising and coaching on agile and digital transformations
	-Building custom full-stack applications and software packages
	-Rapidly prototyping iPad and web apps
	-Creating and implementing big data solutions</p><p>Despite being part of a large, multinational organization, MDL works more like a small startup, employing small, flexible teams. We use agile methodologies to iterate quickly towards the solutions we need. We combine the latest open source technologies together with traditional Enterprise software products.</p><p>Our office culture is casual, fun and social, with an emphasis on education and innovation. We have the freedom to try new ideas, experiment and are expected to be constantly learning and growing.</p><p>We are looking for interns in three roles:</p><p>Designer-
These candidates have experience in visual design and, ideally, photoshop or illustrator.
Designers create the look and feel of applications, from high-level wireframe concepts to high-fidelity designs. They translate client business requirements, user needs, and technical capabilities into designs that are visually exciting, easy to use, and emotionally engaging. Much of our work makes heavy use of data visualization.</p><p>Developer-
These candidates have a background in computer science.
Our developers fall roughly into three categories:
	- Front-end/UI devs (HTML, CSS, JS, Angular.js, D3, etc.)
	- Server-side devs (Clojure, Node.js, .NET, Java, Ruby, etc.)
	- Data engineers (Hadoop, SQL, etc.)
We use a broad range of technologies to meet unique client needs, and so being able to learn quickly and adapt is a must. We value the new techniques and technologies shared from experimentation and self-learning. Experience with pair programming, agile, and test-driven development is a plus.</p><p>Product Owner-
POs generally come from a business or computer science background.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Rinse ( <a href="http://www.rinse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rinse.com</a> ) - San Francisco, CA 
(REMOTE a possibility if you live in a major US city)<p>Rinse is a very early-stage startup (we are only 6 people currently) looking to bring technology to the dry-cleaning industry. The industry is ripe for innovation! We're building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for over 6 months now! I know 'app for laundry' is a tech cliché right now, but we're definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we're solving it.</p><p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading cleaning operations, a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition, and a former Army Ranger managing our driver corps. I'm Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.</p><p>We're looking for a Full-Stack Developer to develop interactivity for our customers and tools for our staff. We're doing things like route scheduling and planning, e-commerce funnel optimization, and analytics gathering for data-driven decision making.</p><p>We're also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and 'growth hacking.' We're building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business. Please see a job description at <a href="http://bit.ly/1dLJigo" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1dLJigo</a> - The sky's the limit!</p><p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.</p><p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 80 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.</p><p>We're well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Engineer (DevOps)</p><p>You can work with cloud hosting platforms such as EC2, and modern deployment tools such as Chef or Puppet.

  - we’re hiring both  mobile and backend developers

  - we believe that even enterprise software can be beautiful, 
    and pride ourselves on our design 

  - every single one of our developers have committed code within their
    first day at work (some within their first hour), and because
    we love continuous deployment, so we're constantly pushing to
    production and seeing the impact of our work

Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p></p><pre><code>  - building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording 
    and streaming; imagine thousands of applicants from countries 
    all around the world submitting video interviews right before a deadline

  - designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and
    employers alike 

  - presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user,
    and our team internally
</code></pre>
Our toolkit involves Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), MySQL (and some MongoDB), Celery, RabbitMQ, Wowza Media Server.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">St. Louis, MO - Business &amp; Technology Applications Analyst I (entry level position) - The Genome Institute - 26988<p>The Genome Institute at Washington University has an opening for a talented software engineer in the Bioinformatics group. The position will work with an experi
enced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects.</p><p>The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.</p><p>The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.</p><p>Washington University in St. Louis is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer and encourages applications from women, ethnic minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities.</p><p>Degree or certification from a technical school or college in computer programming required; experience in computer programming and/or relevant DBA experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for required education.</p><p>Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.</p><p>Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.</p><p>This position is full-time and works approximately 40 hours per week.
