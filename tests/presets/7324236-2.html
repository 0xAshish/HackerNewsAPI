This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.</p><p>We're looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we've got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.</p><p>So far this year, we've built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive's gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We're currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].</p><p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don't realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world's largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.</p><p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you.

We've grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year. Our team has surged to 30+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $100k/month in just 9 months.</p><p>Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit last week.</p><p>But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We've built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.</p><p>We've recently became Microsoft's premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. We are installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That's right mateys, we're in the source code.</p><p>And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you'll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.</p><p>So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do "expense reports that don't suck!" (Google "expensify" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Academia.edu, San Francisco, CA<p>Academia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.</p><p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.</p><p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.</p><p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."</p><p>Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.
If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">New York<p>Junior/Senior developers at DaisyBill</p><p>We're looking for 1-2 developers who are experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. We don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is a plus.</p><p>We're also looking for someone at the CTO level.</p><p>DaisyBill is located at 34 W 15th Street in Manhattan. We're a SaaS vendor serving the workers' compensation e-billing market.</p><p>Workers' comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical e-billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that treats the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.</p><p>DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.</p><p>You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.</p><p>The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.</p><p>We use Git for source control and use Macs for development.

We’re currently hiring full stack web developers who have a solid portfolio of building product at startups. Our stack is Rails + AngularJS + iOS.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">We're Hiring at Prismatic (getprismatic.com)<p>The office is located in SOMA in San Francisco.</p><p>=============</p><p>Frontend Engineer at Prismatic: iOS, Web, and Android.
<a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5971" rel="nofollow">http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5971</a></p><p>==</p><p>Strong CS basics in data structures and algorithms.  Strong engineering;
thoughtful design and clean code.  Graphics, browser, games, or animation
experience a big plus.</p><p>A front-end engineer that has a strong computer science background, but wants
to focus on product engineering rather than backend systems.  You don’t want to
just take off the shelf UI components, but want to explore new interactions.
You aren’t afraid to dig under the hood of iOS frameworks or browser code in
order to make an animation or interaction feel natural and smooth.</p><p>=============</p><p>Backend Engineer at Prismatic:
<a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976" rel="nofollow">http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976</a></p><p>==</p><p>Prismatic is a great place to be a backend engineer - we analyze millions of
shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands
of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown,
lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine.  We are looking to
grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.</p><p>We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one 
area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine
learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so
you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers
who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts.
Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to
work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to
either. We do, however, expect the following:</p><p>- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess.
- You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs.
- You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful.
- You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two.
- You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.
- You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.</p><p>Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:</p></font><p><font color="#000000">- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive
- Building out new product features in our API 
- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly
- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more
- Creating tools to assist development and ops 
- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325616" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7325616&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%30%4d%6f%6e%70%47%73%43%6b%63%47%62%41%37%72%63%62%64%32%42%41%50"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325616"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sbuccini">sbuccini</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7325616">link</a></span></div><br>

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services using Puppet and Capistrano; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK's leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">NODE.JS positions in Berlin/Germany—all full-time and permanent<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:</p><p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).</p><p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).</p><p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.</p><p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.</p><p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.
Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.</p><p>All job offers =&gt; <a href="http://urge.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://urge.io/jobs</a></p><p>Mail addresse =&gt; career &lt;at&gt; versus &lt;dot&gt; com</p></font><p><font color="#000000">NEW: EDITOR IN CHIEF position open for a new tech related online publication</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./7324236-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7335582" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7335582&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%30%4d%6f%6e%70%47%73%43%6b%63%47%62%41%37%72%63%62%64%32%42%41%50"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7335582"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jessica_Cotap">Jessica_Cotap</a> 29 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7335582">link</a></span></div><br>

Our HQ is located in San Francisco, CA<p>Company Overview: Cotap helps people work better together. We’re building mobile tools to help people communicate and collaborate at work, whether they’re knowledge workers or line workers. Mobile phones can mean more than photo-sharing or checkins. They can mean better day-to-day work and more opportunities for people who were left out in the past.</p><p>What we are looking for: We’re looking for someone to help us build an amazing web experience, both for mobile and desktop. Our product is aimed primarily at mobile users, so it’s very important that our pages are responsive on smaller screens, touch-friendly, and lightweight, while also looking great on traditional desktop displays. We have a ridiculously talented set of engineers and we’re looking for a front-end developer to join us. You’ll have a ton of technical autonomy: should we use Ember, Backbone, something else, or nothing? You lead those decisions.</p><p>Why us:
We’re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. We’re also small, which means we don’t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days. Our passion is building great products and our goal is to bring them to a wider audience than the web ever let us reach.

This is our moonshot moment – the chance to re-invent the QSR industry and to transform the restaurant experience via digital screens.</p><p>Everyone — not just customers — should love the restaurant experience. Today, it's pretty good, but it's not perfect. From the point of sale, to mobile applications, to employee training, to embedded interfaces, to supply-chain management, we're hacking our systems to make them all better...forever.</p><p>Along the way, we'll radically change how restaurants interact with customers. We're making systems that create 1-to-1 communications, that build personalized food experiences, and that learn and get better with every sale.</p><p>With your help, we'll build the best interfaces in the industry.</p><p>And the best part? It's in Oklahoma. This is your chance to be a part of a movement, to play an integral role in a growing tech community that's bringing economic growth and innovation to the Heartland.</p><p>Fair warning: things are run differently around here. Our culture is inspired by a new way of working. 
Your environment is part-startup, part-end-up:</p><p>Have autonomy and a say in your product, without putting in 70 hours a week.
Take risks on new ideas, yet have predictable funding and runway.
Have permission to fail, without worrying about the company going under.
Your team wants you to take 14-day vacations.</p><p>Are you at a start-up with a life-span near its finish?
Are you a talented member of a team at a popular technology company looking for the opportunity to have more say over what you do?
Are you a workhorse at an agency, tired of creating products for promotions instead of real users?
Are you an adventurer, looking to be a part of a growing community that's making a huge regional economic difference?</p><p>Join us. We're currently accepting inquiries for a spring 2014 start date for an OKC-based role.</p><p>- Product Owner: Act as the strategic lead for a new product innovation lab. Create our products' vision, make key decisions without much oversight, and own the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly.

We will build on this momentum with this exciting new initiative that will transform participatory research and advance human health.</p><p>Our current hiring position is focusing on someone with back-end web development skills, as we have plans to work with a design firm for initial front-end work. Because we plan to develop open source software used by researchers, we believe Python (which many scientists use) is generally preferred.</p><p>We're looking for someone who...</p><p>-- Is interested in building and managing a full-stack website.

PersonalGenome.org's mission is to make a wide spectrum of data about humans accessible to increase biological literacy and improve human health. Its efforts are informed by values encouraging greater transparency and collaboration between researchers and participants. The organization supports the Personal Genome Project (PGP) global network. The first PGP research study was founded at Harvard Medical School in 2005, and PGP sites now exist at leading institutions in four countries. We also produce the annual Genomes, Environments and Traits (GET) Conference.
